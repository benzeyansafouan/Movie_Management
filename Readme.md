This Spring Boot REST Controller is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to movies management. It exposes three endpoints for performing various operations on movies - getting a list of all movies, getting a list of recommended movies by genre, and saving a movie.

To ensure that the controller is functioning correctly, it is essential to perform testing. Testing helps identify issues early on in the development process and ensures that the controller behaves as expected under different scenarios. We can perform unit testing on this controller using a testing framework like JUnit.
